## Bio

PhD candidate in economics at [Lancaster University Management School](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/). My research interests are in early childhood development and skill formation, the socio-economic impacts of climate and environmental shocks, and the interaction between these two processes in low and middle income contexts.

I will be a visiting student at ODID, University of Oxford, during trinity term 2023.

Long suffering Scottish rugby fan.
